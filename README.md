# Overview

A simple Node.js project that uses Socket.io to allow multiple buccaneers to connect and sail their ship accross the ocean.

# Requirements

Node.js, npm and CoffeeScript. Everything's setup according to [Heroku's guide](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js).

The `script.js` and `app.js` file are generated by CoffeeScript. You'll need the latest version of CoffeeScript to enable `watching` and `joining` of all files in the `src` folder.

# Running it
